# Notes:

Hello There,
Thank you very much for the opportunity to work in this app :)

# Things Done:

1. Created an API in NodeJs, and a mock since there is No Data Base ( If there was data base then i would need to query the results to the response to be send in Frontend)
2. Real time search (0.5 seconds delay for performace) and made sure to memoize the same query so there is NO need to send many times if user types same words. IMPROVES PERFORMANCE !!!
3. Made a clear Search Button to clean up the filters.
4. Used typescript in frontend.
5. Added 4 tests in App.test.tsx.
6. Mobile friendly.

# Things to be done better if there was more time:

1. Improve performance on checkbox filtering and behaviour when we would have an array of specialities from NodeJs side.
2. Improve some typescript types and definitions _( in 4 places the "any" type can be replaced.)_
3. Add a database instead of a simple mock from Nodejs side.
4. Add a loader when waiting for data. In this case is not needed because i used memolize but in case we had huge load of data coming from database.

## Final Notes

I total worked 3 hours and 40 minutes in this app.
The NodeJs API and mock data was easy to implement. Most of the time was spend in Frontend.

THANK YOU!!! :)
